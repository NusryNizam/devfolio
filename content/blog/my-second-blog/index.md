## Reflections

I was selected for the IT degree programme in Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, I could not be more happy, as this is my dream come true. 

The environment felt different, and I was able to adopt to the changes, and the first year of my university was refreshing. I was able to meet a lot of new friends from various parts of the country.
