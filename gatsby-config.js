    about: `As early in my childhood, I remember fiddling with computers. Since then, I have learned a lot about computers despite the formal education. As soon as I finished school, I decided to pursue Information Technology as my major. I enjoyed learning more about topics and areas I did not know much about, specially programming and graphic designing. I enjoy self-learning. Over the course, I came to understand that the computers had much more to do with the world today than in the past. This motivated me to pursue in a never ending curiosity to explore the world of computers and programming.`,
